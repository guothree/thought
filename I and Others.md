    Racial prejudice exists everywhere and will last until the end of world, because it comes from the nature of human being.
    Let's start from one concept: "us", this word has so many defination, such as family, friends, country, cultrue, religion etc. one person may be considered part of "us" in one context, while being perceived as "other" in a different context, so what is the invariant ? answer is simple, "I" is always us in any context, other exists only because of I.
    Human being divide this world into two parts, I and other. This consciousness doesn't stop here, this is the way of people seeing everything, 
    
    I am myself, other is everyone else.
    I am one of my famliy, other is people out of my famliy.
    I am christian, other is who doesn't believe in Christianity.
    I am chinese, other is people from other countrys.
    I am white people, other is people which is not white.
    
    This division would be no harm without another evil, "I" hate "other".
