	People always say "Money can not buy you happiness", that's what we have been being taught from the begining, i want to say children are so easy to be cheated. Here i wanne tell you MONEY can buy you happiness.
	Even now if you ask some adults this question, they would still tell you this bullshit is right because they are coward. Someone would make a excause saying you can not tell children this fact because this is bad value even if it's true, and i want to ask why the truth is bad value, so lie can be good value? at least, do not lie to yourself.
