	Today I and Chennie had a talk about what good education is, I am pretty sure that the answer is Happiness, so I told her my understanding, and then she asked me a specific question with expectation of a good answer, the question is how I will educate my future child, however I said I don't know and she got angury. Her reaction suprised me so much, I totally had no idea why she was angry. But afterwards I did some thought about this drama and got some results, the problem is "I don't know".
	[Today, Chennie and I had a discussion about what constitutes good education. I firmly believe that the answer is happiness, so I shared my perspective with her. She then posed a specific question, expecting a well-thought-out response: How I would educate my future child. However, when I admitted that I didn't know, she became angry. Her reaction suprised me greatly, I was completely baffled by her anger. Upon reflection, I realized the issue stemmed from my response of "I don't know"]
	I used to be shamed of saying this words, it makes me feel stupid, and now I don't mind that, because people can not know everything, real stupidness is pretending to know what you don't know. Obviously, it didn't fit the situation today, at least I said inappropriate words to her, I have to find out the nature of problem in order to make it happen again.
	[I used to be ashamed of saying "I don't know", it made me feel stupid. Now however I don't mind admitting when I lack knowledge. I've realized that people can't know everything, and true ignorance lies in pretending to know what you don't. Obviously, my response didn't fit the situation today, at the very least I used inappropriate words with her, I need to identify the root of problem to prevent it from happening again.]
	During our little talk, this words just killed it, it doesn't matter if you know or not, because we were reasoning, knowing it was our purpose, not prerequisite, it's like you were learning new language, of course you don't know about it at the begaining, otherwise you don't need to learn it, so you can refuse to learning because you don't know it. In this situation, saying "I dont't konw" is not smart to show that you have courage to admit lacking knowledge, but the cowardice to continue talking it.
	[During our conversation, those words effectively ended the discuession. In reality, whether I knew the answer or not wasn't the point - we were engaged in the process of reasoning together. Knowledge wasn't the prerequisite, it was our goal. It's analogous to learn a new language: of course you don't know it at the begaining, otherwise there would be no need to learn. You can't refuse to learn simply because you don't know it yet. In this context, saying "I don't know" wasn't a display of courage in admiting a lack of knowledge, but rather a show of reluctance to engage in futher discussion.]
