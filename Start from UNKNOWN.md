    The start is the most dangerous time, so many things can stop you. But these are what you have to conquer.
    
    You can't just start from ZERO, it's too slow. Morden software is so complicated that no one can solve all problems, you have to stand on the shoulders of a giant. let's suppose that you plan to build a website from scratch and know little about HTML、CSS and JS, where are you going to start? Of course not to learn from books about them, you are an engineer, not a student. Just find a simple template from the internet and build and deploy it until all components work well as a whole. 
    
    As a newbie, this period is so important and it has a name called Technology Selection which will affect everything from now. How to choose? the answer is the one that is the most mature and has the biggest ecosystem. 

	After deployment, it's time to build your application with SIMPLE and SLOW steps. one small feature at a time. The whole project is a black box right now, you know nothing about how it works, it's fine, you don't need to, you will learn in practice.
