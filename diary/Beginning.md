    I have been contemplating various ways to improve my English skill, like tried to speaking with my girlfirend, searched for classes with a teacher, and even attempted writing words in Reddit, however none of them worked well. so I decided to try another way: "Diary", actually it's not the real tradtional diary where I will record my daily activities, what I want to do is just to writing some words every day, forcing me to keep practicing, since currently there are no any opportunities to let me use English, I have to make one myself.

    Today, We arrived in Siargao Island, hoping next four days would be good. but when I got off the plane, it's not like what i was looking forward to see, sky was grey with sun hiding behind the cloud, looks like rain was gonne come. after 50 minutes of sitting on van, we finally arrived in hotel, tired and hungry, rain didn't come as I expected, on the contrary, sunshine escaped from crack of cloud, it made me feel better, hoping dark clouds would disappear soon.
    The food was really great, spaghetti、nacos、garlic rice etc. I was wondering if the chef should start his or her own resturant, I will definetly visit there. After lunch, the sky didn't get better, my sunshine plan was out for today.

	"There are Eight elevators in this building. They are divide into two parts, one is for High Zone which is starting from 35nd floor, another is for Low Zone which is below 35nd floor"
	
	Another working late day. We have been busy since boss decided dissolve office and let everyone work from home, today is not special, arrived home around 7:30pm, she was still in office dealing with so much stuff. I had no idea about dinner, cooking or ordering online.... ok, make it quick, bought one instant noodle from Chinese store downstairs, dinner is so easy.
	When I was waiting elevator in the lobby, a forgeigner asked me which elevator he could use and he wanted to go to 54nd floor and I gave the answer by telling him how to use elevators, but I am not happy about the words I speaked which was not concise and clear. It reminds me of the first time I answered about this question, that time was much worse, I couldn't even say a whole sentence. so I decided to write the words in advance, so for third time words will come out fluently and then I must be satisfied.

	Today is the last day working in the office, I will work from home starting tomorrow. It's hard to tell if this is a good thing to do, working in the office is totally different from working home. Like role play, office is a place where you are a employee , but home is a my own place, I don't want to be a employee here.
	Another concern I have is about productivity. In office my solo focus is on coding and impletementing features, However working from home presents numerous distractions such as the comfort of my bed, the allure of TV, and the temptation of video games, all of which can impede my work progress. While I can certainly discipline myself to concentrate on tasks, the mere presence of these distractions is problematic. These issues simple don't exist in an office setting.
	[In office the only thing I do is coding, impletementing features, but in home there are so many other thinks distracting me, bed, TV, game etc that stop me from do my job, of course I can make me focus on tasks, but distracting itself is problem, I would never see these problem in office]

	I noticed a simple thing recently, which is I only make money from my current work, sallary is the solo source of income, so I started to think if I have another way to make money. First idea came really fast and I did it, puting my little studio in Airbnb hoping easy money comes quickly, but from last four month, the profit is not good enough to encourage me keeping do it, but at least I have second way to make pocket money.
	[Recently, I had a simple yet profound realization: my salary was my sole source of income. This epiphany prompted me to explore additional avenues for generating revenue. My first idea came swiftly, and I acted on it without hesitation - I listed my small studio on Airbnb, hoping for a quick and easy influx of cash. However, over the past four months, the profits have follen short of my initial expectations. While not substantial enought to be truly encouraging, this venture has at least provided me with a modest secondary income stream. Despite it limitations, it's reassuring to have an alternative means of earning some extra pocket money.]

	Live is much harder without Chennie, since she left, I feel like the last person remaining in this world, there is no one to share my thoughts, no one to have a interesting conversation, no to listen my complain. My meal have become mere survival rations, existing solely to stave off hunger - a stark contrast to our carefully planned weekly menus that balanced meat, seafood and vegetables. Even at the gym, her absence echoes loudly reminding me of how warm companion is. The world has grown cold and lonely, as if all its warmth departed with her.

	Everything has changed after losing it, I didn't even notice when it was still present. If I were smart enough, necessary preparation would be done.
